The company have determined that to begin they would like the system to monitor the status of gthe IoT device in some way.
Suitable methods would be to monitor CPU load (percentage), CPU temperature or similar.

They have asked fot the CPU load as a base indicator.

Create a new python file called "monitor.py" in the monitor folder.

Using a suitable method, design and develop the code to monitor the CPU in some way.

The code in the sensor monitoring should run once every 5 seconds.

To test:
- Make sure the monitor shows the current data on screen
- Have the code execute for 60 seconds (ie repeat 12 times)
